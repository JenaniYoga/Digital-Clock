# Digital Clock
This Python script creates a simple digital clock using the Tkinter library. It displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds, updating every 200 milliseconds.

## Usage
- Run the `Digital Clock.py` file.
- The digital clock will appear in a window titled "Digital Clock - Jenani Robotics".
- The clock will continuously update to reflect the current time.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Install Tkinter if not already installed. You can install Tkinter using pip:
   pip install tk
3. Run the script by executing `Digital Clock.py`.

## Functionality
- The script imports the necessary modules: `Tkinter` and `time`.
- It defines a function `digital()` which continuously updates the displayed time every 200 milliseconds.
- The script creates a Tkinter window titled "Digital Clock - Jenani Robotics" and a label to display the time.
- Finally, it starts the Tkinter event loop using `root.mainloop()`.
  
## About
This script is a simple demonstration of creating a digital clock using Python's Tkinter library. It can be used as a learning resource for understanding basic GUI programming with Tkinter and time manipulation in Python.
